# Introduction

In this project, we will look to see if there is a relationship between how many hours per day someone listens to music and their age and mental health. To do this, we used [data collected from a music and mental health survey](https://www.kaggle.com/code/laurenlavelle/mental-health-and-music-analysis/input).

# Making categories for Anxiety, Depression, and Insomnia

Since our data had people rate their anxiety, depression, and insomnia on a scale of 1 to 10 (only integers), we will make categories for `Anxiety`, `Depression`, and `Insomnia` so that the categories will be binary. For example, for `Anxiety`, we will have a category called `Anxious` that is 1 if `Anxiety` > 5 and 0 otherwise.
```{r, echo = FALSE, results= FALSE, message=FALSE}
# mark people as anxious (1) if anxiety > 5, not anxious (0) otherwise
data$Anxious = ifelse(Anxiety > 5, 1, 0)
# mark people as depressed (1) if depression > 5, not depressed (0) otherwise
data$Depressed = ifelse(Depression > 5, 1, 0)
# mark people as insomniac (1) if insomnia > 5, not insomniac (0) otherwise
data$Insomniac = ifelse(Insomnia > 5, 1, 0)

head(data)
attach(data)
```
# Testing Non-linearity

We don't need to test for non-linearity for categorical variables so we will only test for non-linearity for the continuous variables, namely age.
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(pivot_longer(data = data, 2), aes(Hours.per.day, Age)) + labs(title = 'Age vs. Hours per day') +
    theme_minimal() + geom_point()
```
There doesn't seem to be a linear relationship between age and hours per day. We can transform age by logging it so that the relationship looks less non-linear.
With log age:
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# log transform because there are a few high values and many low values
ggplot(pivot_longer(data = data, 2), aes(Hours.per.day, log(Age))) + labs(title = 'log(Age) vs. Hours per day') +
    theme_minimal() + geom_point()
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
hist(Hours.per.day)
# Hours per day is not normal so we can log transform it or use gamma glm
```
Since the hours per day that people listen to music is not normally distributed, for each of the models, we will have a model where we log Hours.per.day and a model where we fit it to a log-link Gamma distribution.

Also, since half our models will have log Hours.per.day, we check if the relationship with log(Age) and log(Hours.per.day  + 1) is linear.
```{r, echo = FALSE}
# log transform because there are a few high values and many low values
ggplot(pivot_longer(data = data, 2), aes(log(Hours.per.day + 1), log(Age))) + labs(title = 'log(Age) vs. log(Hours per day + 1') +
    theme_minimal() + geom_point()
```
The relationship between log(Age) and log(Hours.per.day + 1) is not obviously non-linear, so we can use log(Age) in the linear model with log(Hours.per.day + 1).

# Fitted models

For fitA, which will have a log model, `fitAlog`, and a gamma generalized linear model (glm), `fitAgamma`, with covariates `log(Age)`,`Anxious`, `Depressed`, `Insomniac`, and `Music.effects`.  
`Anxious`, `Depressed`, and `Insomniac` are the binary categories we made earlier.  
`Music.effects` is a categorical variable in which people reported what effect they felt music had on their mental health. The categories for `Music.effects` are `Improve`, `No effect`, and `Worsen`.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 11, fig.height = 6}
# fitA where we log Hours.per.day + 1 since Hours.per.day is not normally distributed.
fitAlog <- lm(log(Hours.per.day + 1) ~ log(Age) + Anxious + Depressed + Insomniac + Music.effects)
summary(fitAlog)

# Residuals vs. Fitted Values Plot and QQ Plot
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(fitAlog, which = c(1,2))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 11, fig.height = 6}
# fitA where it's fitted to a gamma distribution
# For both fitAlog and fitAgamma, we add 1 to Hours.per.day because we can't log zero.
fitAgamma <- glm(Hours.per.day + 1~ log(Age) + Anxious + Depressed + Insomniac + Music.effects,
                 family = Gamma (link = 'log'))
summary(fitAgamma)

# Residuals vs. Fitted Values Plot and QQ Plot
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(fitAgamma, which = c(1,2))
```

For the fitB's, `fitBlog` and `fitBgamma`, we used only the covariates that were individually significant in `fitA` and `fitAgamma`. As a result, the covariates for `fitBlog` and `fitBgamma` are `log(Age)`, `Depressed`, and `Insomniac`.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 11, fig.height = 6}
# log Hours.per.day +1
fitBlog <- lm(log(Hours.per.day + 1) ~ log(Age) + Depressed + Insomniac)
summary(fitBlog)

# Residuals vs. Fitted Values Plot and QQ Plot
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(fitBlog, which = c(1,2))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 11, fig.height = 6}
# gamma glm
fitBgamma <- glm(Hours.per.day + 1 ~ log(Age) + Depressed + Insomniac,
                 family = Gamma (link = 'log'))
summary(fitBgamma)

# Residuals vs. Fitted Values Plot and QQ Plot
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(fitBgamma, which = c(1,2))
```

# AIC
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = FALSE}
AIC(fitAlog)
AIC(fitBlog)

AIC(fitAgamma)
AIC(fitBgamma)
```
AIC(fitAlog) = `r AIC(fitAlog)`   
AIC(fitBlog) = `r AIC(fitBlog)`  

AIC(fitAgamma) = `r AIC(fitAgamma)`  
AIC(fitBgamma) = `r AIC(fitBgamma)`

# BIC
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = FALSE}
BIC(fitAlog)
BIC(fitBlog)

BIC(fitAgamma)
BIC(fitBgamma)
```
BIC(fitAlog) = `r BIC(fitAlog)`   
BIC(fitBlog) = `r BIC(fitBlog)`  

BIC(fitAgamma) = `r BIC(fitAgamma)`  
BIC(fitBgamma) = `r BIC(fitBgamma)`  

# AIC and BIC analysis
fitAlog is a better fit than fitBlog according to AIC because it has a lower AIC.
fitBlog is a better fit than fitAlog according to BIC because it has a lower BIC.

fitAgamma is a better fit than fitBgamma according to AIC because it has a lower AIC.
fitBgamma is a better fit than fitAgamma according to BIC because it has a lower BIC.
